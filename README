       [1m-i(value)[0m
           Max IDAT chunk size in bytes (minimum: 1024; default: 524288).

       [1m-p  [22mProcesses all files, not just -iphone ones (for debugging purposed
           only).

       [1m-d  [22mVery verbose processing (for debugging purposes only).




[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       pngdefry attempts to remove -iphone optimization from PNG files that
       are processed with Apple's modified pngcrush.

       It removes the private critical data chunk "CgBI" if this is at the
       very start of the PNG file, unpacks IDAT chunks, reverses BGR(A) pixel
       order to RGB(A), undoes pre-multiplied alpha, repacks IDAT chunks, and
       outputs all to a new file.  This is a command-line program with batch
       capabilities (e.g., pngdefry *.png).

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       None.

[1mFILES[0m
       None.
