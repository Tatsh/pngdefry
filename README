NAME
       pngdefry - Removes -iphone optimization and reorders RGB(A) pixels for PNG images

SYNOPSIS
	 pngdefry [-soaplvid] file.png [file.png [...]]

OPTIONS
       -s(suffix)
	   Appends suffix to output file name.

       -o(path)
	   Writes output file(s) to path.  Note: without -s or -o, NO output will be created.

       -a  Do NOT de-multiply alpha.

       -l  Lists all chunks.

       -v  Verbose processing.

       -i(value)
	   Max IDAT chunk size in bytes (minimum: 1024; default: 524288).

       -p  Processes all files, not just -iphone ones (for debugging purposed only).

       -d  Very verbose processing (for debugging purposes only).

       -C  Ignore invalid checksums on chunks (not recommended)

DESCRIPTION
       pngdefry attempts to remove -iphone optimization from PNG files that are processed with Apple's modified pngcrush.

       It removes the private critical data chunk "CgBI" if this is at the very start of the PNG file, unpacks IDAT chunks, reverses BGR(A) pixel order
       to RGB(A), undoes pre-multiplied alpha, repacks IDAT chunks, and outputs all to a new file.  This is a command-line program with batch
       capabilities (e.g., pngdefry *.png).

ENVIRONMENT
       None.

FILES
       None.
